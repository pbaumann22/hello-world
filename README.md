# hello-world
This is for a tutorial on branching

I've used many different versioning systems and even performed configuration management using clearcase. 
So, I'm taking tutorials on GIT to learn the basics of more commonly used versioning systems. 

I'm also an engineer and a writer. Maybe I'll use GIT to store and branch my next novel?
